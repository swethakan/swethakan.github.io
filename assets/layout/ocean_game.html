						<h2>Problem Space</h2>
						<h3>Creating empathy</h3>
						<p>It’s easy to say we need to move houses away from the coastline but harder to explain why this hasn’t happened yet. We needed to explain the human factor of the problem to create empathy for the situation.</p>

					<div data-aos="fade-down" class = "solution inner">
						<h2>Solution</h2>
						<h3>The Ocean Game</h3>
						<p>The game put players in the shoes of power and had them try moving residents away from the coastline. Though this, the user can develop empathy for coastal communities.</p>

							<h3>Interview & synthesis</h3>

							<p class = "first">Rosanna Xia, a reporter at the Los Angeles Times, was introduced to this problem space through her beat as an environmental reporter. Rosanna conducted <b>interviews</b> a variety of environmentalists, beach-goers, homeowners who had beachside properties and more. Together, her and Editor, Ben Muessig, created a <b>concept map</b> about what they felt a newsgame could be.</p>

							<h3>Takeaways</h3>
							<ul class = "numbered">
								<li><b>Current State - </b>There are three main solutions to combat rising sea levels: adding sand to beaches, creating rock walls, or moving coastal communities inland.<br><br><b class = "result">Result:</b> We added options in the game that reflected the current state.</li>
								<li><b>Stakeholders - </b>There are multiple stakeholders in this argument including beach-goers, scietists, homeowners, and more.<br><br><b class = "result">Result:</b> Characters were put in the game to represent stakeholders so users can see all sides of the argument.</li>
								<li class = "last"><b>Moving coastal communities - </b>Often times, money and other incentives are not enough to convince coastal communities to relocate.<br><br><b class = "result">Result:</b> We made the main objective of the game to figure out what <i>will</i> convince communities to move.</li>

							<p>Meanwhile, Terry Castleman and I also assessed the state of newsgames at the time by doing <b>market research</b> into the existing landscape. We found what worked and what did not and also observed what tools other newsrooms used to envoke empathy.</p>
						</div>
						<div data-aos="fade-left" class = "text inner overflow-hide">
							<h3>Takeaways</h3>
							<ul class = "numbered">
								<li><b>Create a story: </b>Many successful newsgames that function similar to text adventures.<br><br><b class = "result">Result:</b> We made our game have a branching narrative with multiple endings.</li>
								<li><b>Show value exchange: </b>Some newsgames turn money, effort, etc. into a points system. This worked to demonstrate the value flows in any particular situation.<br><br><b class = "result">Result:</b> We used the existing money flows to model similar flows in the game.</li>
								<li class = "last"><b>Skip tutorials: </b>Newsgames with many 'tutorials' often lose audience interest.<br><br><b class = "result">Result:</b> We made a game that copies design patterns from other common games (such as the Oregon Trail) to skip the need for too much tutorials.</li>

					<h2>Goals</h2>
					<p>We wanted to show the primary stakeholders in this problem space - it is not just the home owners who are affected but also goverment workers, scientists, and everyday beach-goers. </p>
					<p>We also wanted to show how difficult it is to convince actual homeowners to leave their property, even with a sizable financial incentive. </p>
					<p>Finally, we wanted to demonstrate just how hairy this process is. It’s not an easy solution, even though scientist insist that it’s the only one.</p>

							<h3>User testing</h3>
							<img alt = "Mid-fi mockup shows a beachside view with a city at the edge of the water" src = "../images/projects/beaches/image3.jpg">
							<p class = "image-caption">Mid-fi mockup (Swetha Kannan / Los Angeles Times)</p>
							<p class = "first">After exploring the problem space, we made several mockups to present to stakeholders in the newsroom. </p>
							<!-- <p>Some of the biggest elements we added as a result of research was the characters we included that were meant to visualize the stakeholders in this problem space. We also added a buyback system where users would be able to offer financial incentive to move coastal communities. We tried to model these scenerios after real ones we encountered in our interviews.</p> -->

							<p>We <b>playtested the game</b>, using a text-only version created using twine.js, with 5 users and, once we were happy with the text, we began transferring the game to our in-house CMS system.</p>

							<p>Meanwhile, Rosanna also sent the test game to her sources who gave us <b>expert insight</b> into how accurately the game portrays the problem space. They were able to point out inaccuracies, let us know if we've oversimplified the situation, and more.</p>

							<p>I used Cinema 4D to make all the 3D elements you see in the game and then used After Effects to create all the animations. Afterwards, I exported these animations used in the game into Javascript by using the the Bodymovin library.</p>

						</div>
						<div data-aos="fade-left" class = "text inner overflow-hide">
							<h3>Takeaways</h3>
							<ul class = "numbered">
								<li><b>Inaccurate setting - </b>Experts were confused about the location since the mockup screens did not look like a California coastline.<br><br><b class = "result">Result:</b> I replaced high-rise buildings with a large highway, typical of the California coast, and a few one-story houses.</li>
								<li><b>No character interaction - </b>Players did not click on characters meant to represent stakeholders in the game.<br><br><b class = "result">Result:</b> I had the characters speak automatically without user input and without disrupting the flow of the game. Thus, players can see what they want to say and can choose whether or not to ignore it.</li>
								<li><b>Too many value flows - </b>Players were not able to easily jungle or understand the point systems (funds, beach health, and popularity).<br><br><b class = "result">Result:</b> The beach health and popularity point systems were scrapped leaving only the funds system.</li>
								<li class = "last"><b>No empathy for coastal communities - </b>Users got too frustrated trying to move coastal homeowners.<br><br><b class = "result">Result:</b>  We made speech bubbles for homeowners and assigned them children, families, etc. to make these characters feel fleshed out.</li>

							<p>The page published to great success. It was met with steady and increasing traffic for a week, a time frame almost unheard of in a fast-paced news cycle, and was one of our top viewed project pages of the year. Beyond the initial publishing week, the game has been used by professionals to teach students about the complexities of our beaches and to train local city officials before they began their duties assisting the development of beachside neighborhoods.</p>
