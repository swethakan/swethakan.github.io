						<h3>The Ocean Game</h3>
						<p>The game put players in the shoes of power and had them try moving residents away from the coastline. Though this, the user was introduced more detailed understanding of this space.</p>

							<p class = "first">Rosanna Xia, a reporter at the Los Angeles Times, was introduced to this problem space through her beat as an environmental reporter. Rosanna interviewed a variety of environmentalists, beach-goers, homeowners who had beachside properties and more. </p>
							<p>One goal we had in this project was to intorduce different sides of the argument agains and for deserting our coastline. To figure out how to best do this, we held various brainstorming sessions to write down our thoughts and synthesize solutions.</p>
							<p>Terry Castleman and I also assessed the state of newsgames at the time. We did a light market analysis of games and picked out what worked and what did not from each game.</p>
							<p>In the end, we were able to make a tree diagram of how we expected our game to progress. Rosanna started the process with the Editor of the story, Ben Muessig, by using sticky notes to map out the process. Afterwards, we made a more sophisticated mock-up using Twine.js.</p>

					<h2>Goals</h2>
					<p>We wanted to show the primary stakeholders in this problem space - it is not just the home owners who are affected but also goverment workers, scientists, and everyday beach-goers. </p>
					<p>We also wanted to show how difficult it is to convince actual homeowners to leave their property, even with a sizable financial incentive. </p>
					<p>Finally, we wanted to demonstrate just how hairy this process is. It’s not an easy solution, even though scientist insist that it’s the only one.</p>

						<div data-aos="fade-left" class = "text inner overflow-hide">
							<p class = "first">After exploring the problem space, we made several mockups to present to stakeholders in the newsroom. I initially started with a city-scape in a mockup which was wuickly shot down by experts - we instead changed the final landscape to flat land with roads and villas, more typical of the Southern California coast.</p>
							<p>We playtested the game with several users and, once we were happy with the text, we began transferring the game to our in-house CMS system. To do this, I used Cinema 4D to make all the 3D elements you see in the game and then used After Effects to create all the animations.</p>
							<p>We exported these animations into Javascript animations by using the the Bodymovin library.</p>
							<p>Some of the biggest elements of the game that we continuously iterated upon was the characters we included that were meant to visualize the stakeholders in the problem space. These characters would occasionally offer commentry on what the user was doing.</p>
							<p>Another big element was the buyback system where users would be able to offer financial incentive. We tried to model these scenerios after real ones we encountered in our interviews to make it as realistic as possible.</p>

							<p>The page published to great success. It was met with steady and increasing traffic for a week, a time frame almost unheard of in a fast-paced news cycle, and was one of our top viewed project pages of the year. Beyond the initial publishing week, the game has been used by professionals to teach students about the complexities of our beaches and to train local city officials before they began their duties assisting the development of beachside neighborhoods.</p>
