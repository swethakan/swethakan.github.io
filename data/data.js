Fortunately, I was able to get in touch with a representative from Marvel who was have to allow the Times permission to use some of their images. To create the custom illustrations seen on the page, I facilitated contact with Butcher Billy who we were able to commission to create these stunning spreads.",

There were questions about how much credit he actually deserves for creating the Marvel characters and the role of Jack Kirby and other contributors. Additionally, in his old age, Lee had been involved in mounting pressure from family members to divide his fortune. At the time of writing this, Lee had also been implicated in the #metoo movement which made it particularly hard for me to continue. <br>However, instead of stopping the project, we instead included these accusations and controversy within our story, making sure that all readers understood the accusations laid against him.",
